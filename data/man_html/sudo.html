DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ssuuddoo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the superuser or
       another user, as specified by the security policy.  The invoking user's
       real (_n_o_t effective) user-ID is used to determine the user name with
       which to query the security policy.

       ssuuddoo supports a plugin architecture for security policies, auditing,
       and input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute
       their own plugins to work seamlessly with the ssuuddoo front-end.  The
       default security policy is _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, which is configured via the file
       _/_p_r_i_v_a_t_e_/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s, or via LDAP.  See the _P_l_u_g_i_n_s section for more
       information.

       The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to
       run ssuuddoo.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves
       with a password or another authentication mechanism.  If authentication
       is required, ssuuddoo will exit if the user's password is not entered
       within a configurable time limit.  This limit is policy-specific; the
       default password prompt timeout for the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s security policy is 0
       minutes.

       Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to
       run ssuuddoo again for a period of time without requiring authentication.
       By default, the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy caches credentials on a per-terminal
       basis for 5 minutes.  See the _t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p___t_y_p_e and _t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p___t_i_m_e_o_u_t
       options in sudoers(5) for more information.  By running ssuuddoo with the
       --vv option, a user can update the cached credentials without running a
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       On systems where ssuuddoo is the primary method of gaining superuser
       privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax errors in the security
       policy configuration files.  For the default security policy,
       sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using the
       visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are
       introduced.

       When invoked as ssuuddooeeddiitt, the --ee option (described below), is implied.

       Security policies and audit plugins may log successful and failed
       attempts to run ssuuddoo.  If an I/O plugin is configured, the running
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's input and output may be logged as well.

       The options are as follows:

       --AA, ----aasskkppaassss
               Normally, if ssuuddoo requires a password, it will read it from the
               user's terminal.  If the --AA (_a_s_k_p_a_s_s) option is specified, a
               (possibly graphical) helper program is executed to read the
               user's password and output the password to the standard output.
               If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is set, it specifies
               the path to the helper program.  Otherwise, if sudo.conf(5)
               contains a line specifying the askpass program, that value will
               be used.  For example:

                   # Path to askpass helper program
                   Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

               If no askpass program is available, ssuuddoo will exit with an
               error.

       --aa _t_y_p_e, ----aauutthh--ttyyppee=_t_y_p_e
               Use the specified BSD authentication _t_y_p_e when validating the
               user, if allowed by _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f.  The system administrator
               may specify a list of sudo-specific authentication methods by
               adding an “auth-sudo” entry in _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f.  This option is
               only available on systems that support BSD authentication.

       --BB, ----bbeellll
               Ring the bell as part of the password prompt when a terminal is
               present.  This option has no effect if an askpass program is
               used.

       --bb, ----bbaacckkggrroouunndd
               Run the given _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the background.  It is not possible to
               use shell job control to manipulate background processes
               started by ssuuddoo.  Most interactive _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds will fail to work
               properly in background mode.

       --CC _n_u_m, ----cclloossee--ffrroomm=_n_u_m
               Close all file descriptors greater than or equal to _n_u_m before
               executing a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Values less than three are not permitted.
               By default, ssuuddoo will close all open file descriptors other
               than standard input, standard output, and standard error when
               executing a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The security policy may restrict the
               user's ability to use this option.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy only
               permits use of the --CC option when the administrator has enabled
               the _c_l_o_s_e_f_r_o_m___o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e option.

       --cc _c_l_a_s_s, ----llooggiinn--ccllaassss=_c_l_a_s_s
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with resource limits and scheduling priority of
               the specified login _c_l_a_s_s.  The _c_l_a_s_s argument can be either a
               class name as defined in _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f, or a single ‘-’
               character.  If _c_l_a_s_s is --, the default login class of the
               target user will be used.  Otherwise, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d must be run
               as the superuser (user-ID 0), or ssuuddoo must be run from a shell
               that is already running as the superuser.  If the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
               being run as a login shell, additional _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f
               settings, such as the umask and environment variables, will be
               applied, if present.  This option is only available on systems
               with BSD login classes.

       --DD _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, ----cchhddiirr=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the specified _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y instead of the
               current working directory.  The security policy may return an
               error if the user does not have permission to specify the
               working directory.

       --EE, ----pprreesseerrvvee--eennvv
               Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to
               preserve their existing environment variables.  The security
               policy may return an error if the user does not have permission
               to preserve the environment.

       ----pprreesseerrvvee--eennvv==lliisstt
               Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to add
               the comma-separated list of environment variables to those
               preserved from the user's environment.  The security policy may
               return an error if the user does not have permission to
               preserve the environment.  This option may be specified
               multiple times.

       --ee, ----eeddiitt
               Edit one or more _f_i_l_es instead of running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  In lieu
               of a path name, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting
               the security policy.  If the user is authorized by the policy,
               the following steps are taken:

                   1.   Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited
                        with the owner set to the invoking user.

                   2.   The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the
                        temporary files.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy uses the
                        SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables
                        (in that order).  If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
                        EDITOR are set, the first program listed in the _e_d_i_t_o_r
                        sudoers(5) option is used.

                   3.   If they have been modified, the temporary files are
                        copied back to their original location and the
                        temporary versions are removed.

               To help prevent the editing of unauthorized files, the
               following restrictions are enforced unless explicitly allowed
               by the security policy:

                        ••  Symbolic links may not be edited (version 1.8.15
                           and higher).

                        ••  Symbolic links along the path to be edited are not
                           followed when the parent directory is writable by
                           the invoking user unless that user is root (version
                           1.8.16 and higher).

                        ••  Files located in a directory that is writable by
                           the invoking user may not be edited unless that
                           user is root (version 1.8.16 and higher).

               Users are never allowed to edit device special files.

               If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
               Unlike most _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds run by _s_u_d_o, the editor is run with the
               invoking user's environment unmodified.  If the temporary file
               becomes empty after editing, the user will be prompted before
               it is installed.  If, for some reason, ssuuddoo is unable to update
               a file with its edited version, the user will receive a warning
               and the edited copy will remain in a temporary file.

       --gg _g_r_o_u_p, ----ggrroouupp=_g_r_o_u_p
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with the primary group set to _g_r_o_u_p instead of
               the primary group specified by the target user's password
               database entry.  The _g_r_o_u_p may be either a group name or a
               numeric group-ID (GID) prefixed with the ‘#’ character (e.g.,
               ‘#0’ for GID 0).  When running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as a GID, many shells
               require that the ‘#’ be escaped with a backslash (‘\’).  If no
               --uu option is specified, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run as the invoking
               user.  In either case, the primary group will be set to _g_r_o_u_p.
               The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy permits any of the target user's groups to
               be specified via the --gg option as long as the --PP option is not
               in use.

       --HH, ----sseett--hhoommee
               Request that the security policy set the HOME environment
               variable to the home directory specified by the target user's
               password database entry.  Depending on the policy, this may be
               the default behavior.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
               Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.

       --hh _h_o_s_t, ----hhoosstt=_h_o_s_t
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d on the specified _h_o_s_t if the security policy
               plugin supports remote _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s plugin does not
               currently support running remote _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds.  This may also be
               used in conjunction with the --ll option to list a user's
               privileges for the remote host.

       --ii, ----llooggiinn
               Run the shell specified by the target user's password database
               entry as a login shell.  This means that login-specific
               resource files such as _._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, _._b_a_s_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e, or _._l_o_g_i_n will
               be read by the shell.  If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, it is passed
               to the shell as a simple _c_o_m_m_a_n_d using the --cc option.  The
               _c_o_m_m_a_n_d and any _a_r_gs are concatenated, separated by spaces,
               after escaping each character (including white space) with a
               backslash (‘\’) except for alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens,
               and dollar signs.  If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, an interactive
               shell is executed.  ssuuddoo attempts to change to that user's home
               directory before running the shell.  The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is run with an
               environment similar to the one a user would receive at log in.
               Most shells behave differently when a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified as
               compared to an interactive session; consult the shell's manual
               for details.  The _C_o_m_m_a_n_d _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t section in the sudoers(5)
               manual documents how the --ii option affects the environment in
               which a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is run when the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy is in use.

       --KK, ----rreemmoovvee--ttiimmeessttaammpp
               Similar to the --kk option, except that it removes every cached
               credential for the user, regardless of the terminal or parent
               process ID.  The next time ssuuddoo is run, a password must be
               entered if the security policy requires authentication.  It is
               not possible to use the --KK option in conjunction with a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               or other option.  This option does not require a password.  Not
               all security policies support credential caching.

       --kk, ----rreesseett--ttiimmeessttaammpp
               When used without a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, invalidates the user's cached
               credentials for the current session.  The next time ssuuddoo is run
               in the session, a password must be entered if the security
               policy requires authentication.  By default, the ssuuddooeerrss policy
               uses a separate record in the credential cache for each
               terminal (or parent process ID if no terminal is present).
               This prevents the --kk option from interfering with ssuuddoo commands
               run in a different terminal session.  See the _t_i_m_e_s_t_a_m_p___t_y_p_e
               option in sudoers(5) for more information.  This option does
               not require a password, and was added to allow a user to revoke
               ssuuddoo permissions from a _._l_o_g_o_u_t file.

               When used in conjunction with a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d or an option that may
               require a password, this option will cause ssuuddoo to ignore the
               user's cached credentials.  As a result, ssuuddoo will prompt for a
               password (if one is required by the security policy) and will
               not update the user's cached credentials.

               Not all security policies support credential caching.

       --ll, ----lliisstt
               If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, list the privileges for the
               invoking user (or the _u_s_e_r specified by the --UU option) on the
               current host.  A longer list format is used if this option is
               specified multiple times and the security policy supports a
               verbose output format.

               If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified and is permitted by the security
               policy, the fully-qualified path to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is displayed
               along with any _a_r_gs.  If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified but not allowed
               by the policy, ssuuddoo will exit with a status value of 1.

       --NN, ----nnoo--uuppddaattee
               Do not update the user's cached credentials, even if the user
               successfully authenticates.  Unlike the --kk flag, existing
               cached credentials are used if they are valid.  To detect when
               the user's cached credentials are valid (or when no
               authentication is required), the following can be used:
                     sudo -Nnv

               Not all security policies support credential caching.

       --nn, ----nnoonn--iinntteerraaccttiivvee
               Avoid prompting the user for input of any kind.  If a password
               is required for the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to run, ssuuddoo will display an error
               message and exit.

       --PP, ----pprreesseerrvvee--ggrroouuppss
               Preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.  By
               default, the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy will initialize the group vector to
               the list of groups the target user is a member of.  The real
               and effective group-IDs, however, are still set to match the
               target user.

       --pp _p_r_o_m_p_t, ----pprroommpptt=_p_r_o_m_p_t
               Use a custom password prompt with optional escape sequences.
               The following percent (‘%’) escape sequences are supported by
               the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy:

               %H  expanded to the host name including the domain name (only
                   if the machine's host name is fully qualified or the _f_q_d_n
                   option is set in sudoers(5))

               %h  expanded to the local host name without the domain name

               %p  expanded to the name of the user whose password is being
                   requested (respects the _r_o_o_t_p_w, _t_a_r_g_e_t_p_w, and _r_u_n_a_s_p_w flags
                   in sudoers(5))

               %U  expanded to the login name of the user the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be
                   run as (defaults to root unless the --uu option is also
                   specified)

               %u  expanded to the invoking user's login name

               %%  two consecutive ‘%’ characters are collapsed into a single
                   ‘%’ character

               The custom prompt will override the default prompt specified by
               either the security policy or the SUDO_PROMPT environment
               variable.  On systems that use PAM, the custom prompt will also
               override the prompt specified by a PAM module unless the
               _p_a_s_s_p_r_o_m_p_t___o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e flag is disabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s.

       --RR _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, ----cchhrroooott=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
               Change to the specified root _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y (see chroot(8)) before
               running the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The security policy may return an error
               if the user does not have permission to specify the root
               directory.

       --rr _r_o_l_e, ----rroollee=_r_o_l_e
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with an SELinux security context that includes
               the specified _r_o_l_e.

       --SS, ----ssttddiinn
               Write the prompt to the standard error and read the password
               from the standard input instead of using the terminal device.

       --ss, ----sshheellll
               Run the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it
               is set or the shell specified by the invoking user's password
               database entry.  If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, it is passed to the
               shell as a simple command using the --cc option.  The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d and
               any _a_r_gs are concatenated, separated by spaces, after escaping
               each character (including white space) with a backslash (‘\’)
               except for alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens, and dollar
               signs.  If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, an interactive shell is
               executed.  Most shells behave differently when a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
               specified as compared to an interactive session; consult the
               shell's manual for details.

       --tt _t_y_p_e, ----ttyyppee=_t_y_p_e
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with an SELinux security context that includes
               the specified _t_y_p_e.  If no _t_y_p_e is specified, the default type
               is derived from the role.

       --UU _u_s_e_r, ----ootthheerr--uusseerr=_u_s_e_r
               Used in conjunction with the --ll option to list the privileges
               for _u_s_e_r instead of for the invoking user.  The security policy
               may restrict listing other users' privileges.  When using the
               _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy, the --UU option is restricted to the root user
               and users with either the “list” priviege for the specified
               _u_s_e_r or the ability to run any _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as root or _u_s_e_r on the
               current host.

       --TT _t_i_m_e_o_u_t, ----ccoommmmaanndd--ttiimmeeoouutt=_t_i_m_e_o_u_t
               Used to set a timeout for the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  If the timeout expires
               before the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d has exited, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be terminated.
               The security policy may restrict the user's ability to set
               timeouts.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy requires that user-specified
               timeouts be explicitly enabled.

       --uu _u_s_e_r, ----uusseerr=_u_s_e_r
               Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as a user other than the default target user
               (usually rroooott).  The _u_s_e_r may be either a user name or a
               numeric user-ID (UID) prefixed with the ‘#’ character (e.g.,
               ‘#0’ for UID 0).  When running _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds as a UID, many shells
               require that the ‘#’ be escaped with a backslash (‘\’).  Some
               security policies may restrict UIDs to those listed in the
               password database.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy allows UIDs that are not
               in the password database as long as the _t_a_r_g_e_t_p_w option is not
               set.  Other security policies may not support this.

       --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
               Print the ssuuddoo version string as well as the version string of
               any configured plugins.  If the invoking user is already root,
               the --VV option will display the options passed to configure when
               ssuuddoo was built; plugins may display additional information such
               as default options.

       --vv, ----vvaalliiddaattee
               Update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user
               if necessary.  For the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s plugin, this extends the ssuuddoo
               timeout for another 5 minutes by default, but does not run a
               _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Not all security policies support cached credentials.

       ----      The ---- is used to delimit the end of the ssuuddoo options.
               Subsequent options are passed to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       Options that take a value may only be specified once unless otherwise
       indicated in the description.  This is to help guard against problems
       caused by poorly written scripts that invoke ssuuddoo with user-controlled
       input.

       Environment variables to be set for the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may also be passed as
       options to ssuuddoo in the form _V_A_R=_v_a_l_u_e, for example
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=_/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_p_k_g_/_l_i_b.  Environment variables may be
       subject to restrictions imposed by the security policy plugin.  The
       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy subjects environment variables passed as options to the
       same restrictions as existing environment variables with one important
       difference.  If the _s_e_t_e_n_v option is set in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be
       run has the SETENV tag set or the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d matched is AALLLL, the user may
       set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.  See sudoers(5) for
       more information.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN
       When ssuuddoo executes a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, the security policy specifies the
       execution environment for the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Typically, the real and
       effective user and group and IDs are set to match those of the target
       user, as specified in the password database, and the group vector is
       initialized based on the group database (unless the --PP option was
       specified).

       The following parameters may be specified by security policy:

       ••  real and effective user-ID

       ••  real and effective group-ID

       ••  supplementary group-IDs

       ••  the environment list

       ••  current working directory

       ••  file creation mode mask (umask)

       ••  scheduling priority (aka nice value)

   PPrroocceessss mmooddeell
       There are two distinct ways ssuuddoo can run a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       If an I/O logging plugin is configured to log terminal I/O, or if the
       security policy explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal (“pty”)
       is allocated and fork(2) is used to create a second ssuuddoo process,
       referred to as the _m_o_n_i_t_o_r.  The _m_o_n_i_t_o_r creates a new terminal session
       with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal,
       calls fork(2) again, sets up the execution environment as described
       above, and then uses the execve(2) system call to run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in
       the child process.  The _m_o_n_i_t_o_r exists to relay job control signals
       between the user's terminal and the pty the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is being run in.
       This makes it possible to suspend and resume the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d normally.
       Without the _m_o_n_i_t_o_r, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d would be in what POSIX terms an
       “orphaned process group” and it would not receive any job control
       signals from the kernel.  When the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d exits or is terminated by a
       signal, the _m_o_n_i_t_o_r passes the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's exit status to the main ssuuddoo
       process and exits.  After receiving the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's exit status, the main
       ssuuddoo process passes the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's exit status to the security policy's
       close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit
       plugin, and exits.

       If no pty is used, ssuuddoo calls fork(2), sets up the execution
       environment as described above, and uses the execve(2) system call to
       run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the child process.  The main ssuuddoo process waits
       until the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d has completed, then passes the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's exit status
       to the security policy's close function, as well as the close function
       of any configured audit plugins, and exits.  As a special case, if the
       policy plugin does not define a close function, ssuuddoo will execute the
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d directly instead of calling fork(2) first.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy
       plugin will only define a close function when I/O logging is enabled, a
       pty is required, an SELinux role is specified, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d has an
       associated timeout, or the _p_a_m___s_e_s_s_i_o_n or _p_a_m___s_e_t_c_r_e_d options are
       enabled.  Both _p_a_m___s_e_s_s_i_o_n and _p_a_m___s_e_t_c_r_e_d are enabled by default on
       systems using PAM.

       On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is
       responsible for closing the PAM session.  It may also log the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's
       exit status.

   SSiiggnnaall hhaannddlliinngg
       When the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is run as a child of the ssuuddoo process, ssuuddoo will relay
       signals it receives to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals are
       only relayed when the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is being run in a new pty or when the
       signal was sent by a user process, not the kernel.  This prevents the
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d from receiving SIGINT twice each time the user enters control-
       C.  Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught and
       thus will not be relayed to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  As a general rule, SIGTSTP
       should be used instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
       being run by ssuuddoo.

       As a special case, ssuuddoo will not relay signals that were sent by the
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d it is running.  This prevents the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d from accidentally
       killing itself.  On some systems, the reboot(8) utility sends SIGTERM
       to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting the
       system.  This prevents ssuuddoo from relaying the SIGTERM signal it
       received back to reboot(8), which might then exit before the system was
       actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single
       user mode.  Note, however, that this check only applies to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
       run by ssuuddoo and not any other processes that the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may create.
       As a result, running a script that calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8) via
       ssuuddoo may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the
       reboot(8) or shutdown(8) are run using the eexxeecc() family of functions
       instead of ssyysstteemm() (which interposes a shell between the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d and
       the calling process).

   PPlluuggiinnss
       Plugins may be specified via _P_l_u_g_i_n directives in the sudo.conf(5)
       file.  They may be loaded as dynamic shared objects (on systems that
       support them), or compiled directly into the ssuuddoo binary.  If no
       sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it doesn't contain any _P_l_u_g_i_n
       lines, ssuuddoo will use sudoers(5) for the policy, auditing, and I/O
       logging plugins.  See the sudo.conf(5) manual for details of the
       _/_p_r_i_v_a_t_e_/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_._c_o_n_f file and the sudo_plugin(5) manual for more
       information about the ssuuddoo plugin architecture.

EEXXIITT VVAALLUUEE
       Upon successful execution of a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, the exit status from ssuuddoo will
       be the exit status of the program that was executed.  If the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
       terminated due to receipt of a signal, ssuuddoo will send itself the same
       signal that terminated the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       If the --ll option was specified without a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, ssuuddoo will exit with a
       value of 0 if the user is allowed to run ssuuddoo and they authenticated
       successfully (as required by the security policy).  If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
       specified with the --ll option, the exit value will only be 0 if the
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is permitted by the security policy, otherwise it will be 1.

       If there is an authentication failure, a configuration/permission
       problem, or if the given _c_o_m_m_a_n_d cannot be executed, ssuuddoo exits with a
       value of 1.  In the latter case, the error string is printed to the
       standard error.  If ssuuddoo cannot stat(2) one or more entries in the
       user's PATH, an error is printed to the standard error.  (If the
       directory does not exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry
       is ignored and no error is printed.)  This should not happen under
       normal circumstances.  The most common reason for stat(2) to return
       “permission denied” is if you are running an automounter and one of the
       directories in your PATH is on a machine that is currently unreachable.

SSEECCUURRIITTYY NNOOTTEESS
       ssuuddoo tries to be safe when executing external _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds.

       To prevent command spoofing, ssuuddoo checks "." and "" (both denoting
       current directory) last when searching for a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the user's PATH
       (if one or both are in the PATH).  Depending on the security policy,
       the user's PATH environment variable may be modified, replaced, or
       passed unchanged to the program that ssuuddoo executes.

       Users should _n_e_v_e_r be granted ssuuddoo privileges to execute files that are
       writable by the user or that reside in a directory that is writable by
       the user.  If the user can modify or replace the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d there is no
       way to limit what additional _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds they can run.

       By default, ssuuddoo will only log the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d it explicitly runs.  If a
       user runs a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d such as ‘sudo su’ or ‘sudo sh’, subsequent _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds
       run from that shell are not subject to ssuuddoo's security policy.  The
       same is true for _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds that offer shell escapes (including most
       editors).  If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds will have
       their input and/or output logged, but there will not be traditional
       logs for those _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds.  Because of this, care must be taken when
       giving users access to _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds via ssuuddoo to verify that the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
       does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.  For
       information on ways to address this, see the _P_r_e_v_e_n_t_i_n_g _s_h_e_l_l _e_s_c_a_p_e_s
       section in sudoers(5).

       To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information, ssuuddoo
       disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are re-
       enabled for the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d that is run).  This historical practice dates
       from a time when most operating systems allowed set-user-ID processes
       to dump core by default.  To aid in debugging ssuuddoo crashes, you may
       wish to re-enable core dumps by setting “disable_coredump” to false in
       the sudo.conf(5) file as follows:

           Set disable_coredump false

       See the sudo.conf(5) manual for more information.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       ssuuddoo utilizes the following environment variables.  The security policy
       has control over the actual content of the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d's environment.

       EDITOR           Default editor to use in --ee (sudoedit) mode if neither
                        SUDO_EDITOR nor VISUAL is set.

       MAIL             Set to the mail spool of the target user when the --ii
                        option is specified, or when _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t is enabled in
                        _s_u_d_o_e_r_s (unless MAIL is present in the _e_n_v___k_e_e_p list).

       HOME             Set to the home directory of the target user when the
                        --ii or --HH options are specified, when the --ss option is
                        specified and _s_e_t___h_o_m_e is set in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, when
                        _a_l_w_a_y_s___s_e_t___h_o_m_e is enabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, or when
                        _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t is enabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s and HOME is not
                        present in the _e_n_v___k_e_e_p list.

       LOGNAME          Set to the login name of the target user when the --ii
                        option is specified, when the _s_e_t___l_o_g_n_a_m_e option is
                        enabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, or when the _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t option is
                        enabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s (unless LOGNAME is present in the
                        _e_n_v___k_e_e_p list).

       PATH             May be overridden by the security policy.

       SHELL            Used to determine shell to run with --ss option.

       SUDO_ASKPASS     Specifies the path to a helper program used to read
                        the password if no terminal is available or if the --AA
                        option is specified.

       SUDO_COMMAND     Set to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d run by sudo, including any _a_r_gs.
                        The _a_r_gs are truncated at 4096 characters to prevent a
                        potential execution error.

       SUDO_EDITOR      Default editor to use in --ee (sudoedit) mode.

       SUDO_GID         Set to the group-ID of the user who invoked sudo.

       SUDO_PROMPT      Used as the default password prompt unless the --pp
                        option was specified.

       SUDO_PS1         If set, PS1 will be set to its value for the program
                        being run.

       SUDO_UID         Set to the user-ID of the user who invoked sudo.

       SUDO_USER        Set to the login name of the user who invoked sudo.

       USER             Set to the same value as LOGNAME, described above.

       VISUAL           Default editor to use in --ee (sudoedit) mode if
                        SUDO_EDITOR is not set.

       The following examples assume a properly configured security policy.

       To get a file listing of an unreadable directory:

       To shut down a machine:

           $ sudo shutdown -r +15 "quick reboot"

       To make a usage listing of the directories in the /home partition.  The

       Error messages produced by ssuuddoo include:

       editing files in a writable directory is not permitted
             By default, ssuuddooeeddiitt does not permit editing a file when any of
             the parent directories are writable by the invoking user.  This
             avoids a race condition that could allow the user to overwrite an
             arbitrary file.  See the _s_u_d_o_e_d_i_t___c_h_e_c_k_d_i_r option in sudoers(5)
             for more information.

       editing symbolic links is not permitted
             By default, ssuuddooeeddiitt does not follow symbolic links when opening
             files.  See the _s_u_d_o_e_d_i_t___f_o_l_l_o_w option in sudoers(5) for more
             information.

       effective uid is not 0, is sudo installed setuid root?
             ssuuddoo was not run with root privileges.  The ssuuddoo binary must be
             owned by the root user and have the set-user-ID bit set.  Also,
             it must not be located on a file system mounted with the ‘nosuid’
             option or on an NFS file system that maps uid 0 to an
             unprivileged uid.

       effective uid is not 0, is sudo on a file system with the 'nosuid'
       option set or an NFS file system without root privileges?
             ssuuddoo was not run with root privileges.  The ssuuddoo binary has the
             proper owner and permissions but it still did not run with root
             privileges.  The most common reason for this is that the file
             system the ssuuddoo binary is located on is mounted with the ‘nosuid’
             option or it is an NFS file system that maps uid 0 to an
             unprivileged uid.

       fatal error, unable to load plugins
             An error occurred while loading or initializing the plugins
             specified in sudo.conf(5).

       invalid environment variable name
             One or more environment variable names specified via the --EE
             option contained an equal sign (‘=’).  The arguments to the --EE
             option should be environment variable names without an associated
             value.

       no password was provided
             When ssuuddoo tried to read the password, it did not receive any
             characters.  This may happen if no terminal is available (or the
             --SS option is specified) and the standard input has been
             redirected from _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.

       a terminal is required to read the password
             ssuuddoo needs to read the password but there is no mechanism
             available for it to do so.  A terminal is not present to read the
             password from, ssuuddoo has not been configured to read from the
             standard input, the --SS option was not used, and no askpass helper
             has been specified either via the sudo.conf(5) file or the
             SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable.

       no writable temporary directory found
             ssuuddooeeddiitt was unable to find a usable temporary directory in which
             to store its intermediate files.

       The “no new privileges” flag is set, which prevents sudo from running
       as root.
             ssuuddoo was run by a process that has the Linux “no new privileges”
             flag is set.  This causes the set-user-ID bit to be ignored when
             running an executable, which will prevent ssuuddoo from functioning.
             The most likely cause for this is running ssuuddoo within a container
             that sets this flag.  Check the documentation to see if it is
             possible to configure the container such that the flag is not
             set.

       sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set
             ssuuddoo was not run with root privileges.  The ssuuddoo binary does not
             have the correct owner or permissions.  It must be owned by the
             root user and have the set-user-ID bit set.

       sudoedit is not supported on this platform
             It is only possible to run ssuuddooeeddiitt on systems that support
             setting the effective user-ID.

       timed out reading password
             The user did not enter a password before the password timeout (5
             minutes by default) expired.

       you do not exist in the passwd database
             Your user-ID does not appear in the system passwd database.

       you may not specify environment variables in edit mode
             It is only possible to specify environment variables when running
             a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  When editing a file, the editor is run with the

       Many people have worked on ssuuddoo over the years; this version consists
       of code written primarily by:

             Todd C. Miller

       See the CONTRIBUTORS.md file in the ssuuddoo distribution

       people who have contributed to ssuuddoo.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell if
       that user is allowed to run arbitrary _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s via ssuuddoo.  Also, many
       programs (such as editors) allow the user to run _c_o_m_m_a_n_ds via shell
       escapes, thus avoiding ssuuddoo's checks.  However, on most systems it is
       possible to prevent shell escapes with the sudoers(5) plugin's _n_o_e_x_e_c
       functionality.

       It is not meaningful to run the ‘cd’ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d directly via sudo, e.g.,

           $ sudo cd /usr/local/protected

       since when the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d exits the parent process (your shell) will still
       be the same.  The --DD option can be used to run a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in a specific
       _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

       Running shell scripts via ssuuddoo can expose the same kernel bugs that
       make set-user-ID shell scripts unsafe on some operating systems (if
       your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory, set-user-ID shell scripts are
       generally safe).
