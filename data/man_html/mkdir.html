     The mmkkddiirr utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order
     specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the current
     umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     --mm _m_o_d_e        Set the file permission bits of the final created
                    directory to the specified mode.  The _m_o_d_e argument can be
                    in any of the formats specified to the chmod(1) command.
                    If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters
                    ‘+’ and ‘-’ are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
                    “a=rwx”.

     --pp             Create intermediate directories as required.  If this
                    option is not specified, the full path prefix of each
                    operand must already exist.  On the other hand, with this
                    option specified, no error will be reported if a directory
                    given as an operand already exists.  Intermediate
                    directories are created with permission bits of
                    “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus
                    write and search permission for the owner.

     --vv             Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they
                    are created.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.

     The mmkkddiirr utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Create a directory named _f_o_o_b_a_r:

           $ mkdir foobar

     Create a directory named _f_o_o_b_a_r and set its file mode to 700:

           $ mkdir -m 700 foobar

     Create a directory named _c_o_w_/_h_o_r_s_e_/_m_o_n_k_e_y, creating any non-existent
     intermediate directories as necessary:

           $ mkdir -p cow/horse/monkey

     The mmkkddiirr utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”)
     compatible.
