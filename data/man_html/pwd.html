     The ppwwdd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working
     directory to the standard output.

     Some shells may provide a builtin ppwwdd command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     The options are as follows:

     --LL      Display the logical current working directory.

     --PP      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
             links resolved).

     If no options are specified, the --LL option is assumed.

     The ppwwdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     Show current working directory with symbolic links resolved:

           $ /bin/pwd -P
           /usr/home/fernape

     Show the logical current directory.  Then use file(1) to inspect the
     _/_h_o_m_e directory:

           $ /bin/pwd
           /home/fernape
           $ file /home
           /home: symbolic link to usr/home

     The ppwwdd utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ppwwdd command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     In csh(1) the command ddiirrss is always faster because it is built into that
     shell.  However, it can give a different answer in the rare case that the
     current directory or a containing directory was moved after the shell
     descended into it.

     The --LL option does not work unless the PWD environment variable is
     exported by the shell.
